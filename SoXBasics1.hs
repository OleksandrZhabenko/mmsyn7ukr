-- A program and a library that can be used as a simple 
-- basic interface to some SoX functionality or for producing 
-- the approximately Ukrainian speech with your own recorded 
-- voice (actually it produces the needed sound representations). 
-- This module differs from a SoXBasics that the resulting files
-- in it have possibly just the same name as the input ones. The functions
-- try to replace the initial file with the processed one.
